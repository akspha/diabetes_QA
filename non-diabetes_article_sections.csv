2,"Abdominal CT scan",4917445,_INTRO_,"<p>An abdominal CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the belly area. CT stands for computed tomography.</p>"
2,"Abdominal CT scan",4917446,"How the Test is Performed","<p>You will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often,you will lie on your back with your arms raised above the head.</p><p>Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern ""spiral"" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.</p><p>A computer creates separate images of the belly area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can bemade by stacking the slices together.</p><p>You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.</p><p>The scan should take less than 30 minutes.</p>"
2,"Abdominal CT scan",4917447,"How to Prepare for the Test","<p>You need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.</p><ul><li>Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4-6 hours before the test.</li><li>You may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste although some have flavors so that they taste a little better. </li><li>The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.</li><li>Let your doctor know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.</li><li>Before receiving the contrast, tell your health care provider if you take the diabetes medication metformin(Glucophage).People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.</li></ul><p>Too much weight can damage the scanner. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds. </p><p>You will need to take off yourjewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.</p>"
2,"Abdominal CT scan",4917448,"How the Test Will Feel","<p>Lying on the hard table may be a little bit uncomfortable.</p><p>If you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have:</p><ul><li>Slight burning sensation</li><li>Metallic taste in the mouth</li><li>Warm flushing of the body</li></ul><p>These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.</p>"

Let your doctor know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.</p><ul><li>The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting,sneezing, itching,or hives if you get this type of contrast.</li><li>If you must be given such contrast, your doctor may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.</li><li>Yourkidneys help remove iodine out of the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body if you havekidney disease or diabetes.</li></ul><p>Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test.. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.</p>"

7,"Abdominal ultrasound",4917487,_INTRO_,"<p>Abdominal ultrasound is an type of imaging test. It is used to examine organs inthe abdomen including the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. The blood vessels that lead to some of these organs can also be looked at with ultrasound.</p>"
7,"Abdominal ultrasound",4917488,"How the Test is Performed","<p>An ultrasound machine makes images of organs and structures insidethe body. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves thatreflect off body structures. A computer receives thesewaves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with x-rays or CT scans, this test does not expose you toionizing radiation. </p><p>You will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen.</p><p>You may need tochange position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam.</p><p>Most of the time,the testtakes less than 30 minutes.</p>"
7,"Abdominal ultrasound",4917489,"How to Prepare for the Test","<p>Preparation steps vary depending on the problem. Most of the time, people are asked not toeat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do.</p>"
7,"Abdominal ultrasound",4917490,"How the Test Will Feel","<p>There is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feela littlecold and wet.</p>"

8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917497,_INTRO_,"<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look directly at the contents of a patient's abdomen or pelvis.</p>"
8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917498,"How the Test is Performed","<p>The procedure is usually done in the hospital or outpatient surgical center under general anesthesia (while you are asleep and pain-free). However, very rarely, this procedure may also be done using local anesthesia. Thisnumbs only the area affected by the surgery and allows you to stay awake.</p><p>A surgeon makes a small cut below the belly button (navel) and inserts a needle into the area. Carbon dioxide gas is passed into the abdomen to expand the area. This gives the surgeon more room to work, and helps the surgeon see the organs more clearly. </p><p>A tube is placed through the cut in your abdomen. A tiny video camera (laparoscope) goes through this tube and is used to see the inside of your pelvis and abdomen. More small cuts may be made if other instruments are needed to get a better view of certain organs.</p><p>If you are having gynecologic laparoscopy, dye may be injected into your cervix area so the surgeon can better see your fallopian tubes.</p><p>After the exam, the gas, laparoscope, and instruments are removed, and the cuts are closed. You will have bandages over those areas.</p>"
8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917499,"How to Prepare for the Test","<p>Do not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test. You must sign a consent form.</p>"
8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917500,"How the Test Will Feel","<p>If you are given general anesthesia, you will feel no pain during the procedure.The surgical cuts may throb and be slightly painful afterward. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to relieve pain.</p><p>With local anesthesia, you may feel a prick andburning sensation when the local anesthetic is given. The laparoscope may cause pressure, but there should be no pain during the procedure. </p><p>Afterward, you may also feel soreness at the site of the surgical cut. Your doctor may prescribea pain reliever.</p><p>You may also have shoulder pain for a few days. The gas used during the procedure can irritate the diaphragm, which shares some of the same nerves as the shoulder. You may also have an increased urge to urinate, since the gas can put pressure on the bladder.</p><p>You willrecover for a few hours at the hospital before going home. You will probably not stay overnight after a laparoscopy.</p><p>You will not be allowed to drive home. Someone should be available to pick you up after the procedure.</p>"
8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917501,"Why the Test is Performed","<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy helps identify the cause of pain or a growth in the abdomen and pelvic area. It is doneif x-rays or ultrasound results are unclear.</p><p>The procedure may also be done instead of open surgery after an accident to see if there is any injury to the abdomen.</p><p>Laparoscopy may be done before proceduresto treat cancer (such as surgery to remove an organ), to find out whether the cancer has spread. If it has spread, treatmentwill change.</p>"
8,"Diagnostic laparoscopy",4917502,"Normal Results","<p>There is no blood in the abdomen, no hernias, no intestinal obstruction, and no cancer in any visible organs. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are of normal size, shape, and color. The liver is normal.</p>"

10,"Small intestinal ischemia and infarction",4917515,_INTRO_,"<p>Intestinal ischemia and infarction is damage to (ischemia) or death of (infarction) part of the intestine due to a decrease in its blood supply.</p>"
10,"Small intestinal ischemia and infarction",4917516,Causes,"<p>There are several possible causes of intestinal ischemia and infarction.</p><p>Hernia: If the intestine moves into the wrong place or becomes tangled, this can lead to intestinal ischemia.</p><p>Adhesions: The intestine may become trapped in scar tissue from past surgery (adhesions). This can lead to ischemia if left untreated.</p><p>Embolus: A blood clot from the heart or main blood vessels may travel through the bloodstream and block one of the arteries supplying the intestine. People who have had a heart attack or who havearrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, are at risk for this problem.</p><p>Arterial thrombosis: The arteries that supply blood to the intestine may become so narrowed from atherosclerotic disease (cholesterol buildup) that they become blocked. When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack. When it happens in the arteries to the intestine, it causes intestinal ischemia.</p><p>Venous thrombosis: The veins carrying blood away from the intestines may become blocked by blood clots. This blocks blood flow into the intestines. This is more common in people with liver disease, cancer, or blood clotting disorders.</p><p>Low blood pressure: Very low blood pressure in patients who already have narrowing of the intestinal arteries may also cause intestinal ischemia. This typically occurs in patients who are very ill for other reasons. It can be compared to losing water pressure in a hose with a partial blockage.</p>"
10,"Small intestinal ischemia and infarction",4917517,Symptoms,"<p>The hallmark symptom of intestinal ischemia is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Fever</li><li>Vomiting</li></ul>"
10,"Small intestinal ischemia and infarction",4917518,"Exams and Tests","<p>Laboratory tests may show a high white blood cell (WBC) count (a marker of infection) and increased acid in the bloodstream.
