treatments.managing your blood sugarchecking your blood sugar levelsyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.to check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. this gives you a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.yourhealth care provider or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. your doctor will help you seta target range for your blood sugar numbers. keep these factors in mind:most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.if your blood sugar level isunder control, you may only need to checkit a few times a week.you may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at

the best way to improve your diet is by eating a variety of healthy foods. you should learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions. talk to your doctor or dietitian if you are a vegetarian or on some other special diet.in general, your diet should be: moderate in fat and proteinprovide controlled levels of carbohydrates through foods including fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice)lower in foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastriesyou will be asked to eat three small- to moderate- sized meals and one or more snacks each day. do not skip meals and snacks. keep the amount and types of food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) the same from day to day.carbohydratescarbohydrates should make up less than half of the calories you eat.most carbohydrates are found in starchy or sugary foods, such as bread, rice, pasta, cereal, potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, cookies, candy, soda, and other sweets.high-fiber, whole-grain carbohydrates are healthier choices.vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, and spinach) add much more to your health than to your blood sugar. enjoy lots of them.carbohydrates in food are measured in grams. you can learn to count the carbohydrates in the foods that you like and that you eat.grains, beans, and startchy vegetableseat 6 or more servings a day: one serving equals 1 slice bread, 1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal, 1/2 cup cooked rice or pasta, or 1 english muffin.foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.choosecarbohydrate sources with plenty of fiber. eat whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking.eat more low-fat breads, such as tortillas, english muffins, and pita bread.vegetableseat 3 - 5 servings a day: one serving equals 1 cup leafy, green vegetables; 1 cup cooked or chopped raw leafy vegetables; 3/4 cup vegetable juice; or 1/2 cup of chopped vegetables, cooked or raw.choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. you should opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine, carrots, and peppers.fruitseat 2 - 4 servings a day: one serving equals 1 medium whole fruit (such as a banana, apple, or orange); 1/2 cup chopped, frozen, cooked, or canned fruit; or 3/4 cup fruit juice.choose whole fruits more often than juices. they have more fiber. citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best. opt for fruit juices without added sweeteners or syrups.choose fresh fruits and juices, which retain more of their nutritional value than frozen or canned varieties.milk and dairyeat 4 servings a day: one serving equals 1 cup milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 oz. natural cheese, or 2 oz. processed cheese.choose low-fat or nonfat milk or yogurt. yogurt has natural sugar in it, but avoid yogurt with added sugar or artificial sweeteners.dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus (to keep calories and cholesterol in check, though, choose low-fat dairy products).protein (meat, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts)eat 2 - 3 servings a day: one serving equals 2-3 oz. cooked meat, poultry, or fish; 1/2 cup cooked beans; 1 egg; or 2 tablespoons peanut butterchoose fish and poultry more often. remove the skin from chicken and turkey. select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork or wild game.trim all visible fat from meat. bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.foods from this group are excellent sources of b vitamins, protein, iron, and zinc.sweetssweets are high in fat and sugar, so keep portion sizes small.eat sweets that are sugar-free.ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.fatsgo easy on butter, margarine, salad dressing, cooking oil, and desserts. but don't cut fats and oils from your diet entirely. they provide long-term energy for growth and are essential for brain development.in general, you should limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat such as hamburger, cheese, bacon, and butter.other lifestyle changesyour doctor may also suggest a safe exercise plan. walking is usually the easiest type of exercise, but swimming or other low-impact exercises can work just as well. exercise is an important way to keep blood sugar in control.

CHOSEN ANS: 
most women with gestational diabetes are able to control their blood sugar and avoid harm to themselves or their baby.pregnant women with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies at birth. this can increase the chance of problems at the time of delivery, including:birth injury (trauma) because of the baby's large sizedelivery by c-sectionyour baby is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the first few days of life.mothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy.there is a slightly increased risk of the baby dying when the mother has untreated gestational diabetes. controlling blood sugar levels reduces this risk.high blood sugar (glucose) levels often go back to normal after delivery. however, women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth and at regular doctor's appointments to screen for signs of diabetes. many women with gestational diabetes develop diabetes within 5 - 10 years after delivery.

a urine analysis may show high blood sugar. but a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dl. to confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.blood tests:fasting blood glucose level -- diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dl twice. levels between 100 and 126 mg/dl are called impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. these levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.hemoglobin a1c test -- normal: less than 5.7%pre-diabetes: 5.7% - 6.4%diabetes: 6.5% or higheroral glucose tolerance test -- diabetes is diagnosed if glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dl 2 hoursafter drinking a glucose drink. (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes.)screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 yearsoverweight adults (bmi greater than 25) who have other risk factorsadults over age 45, repeated every 3 years

CHOSEN ANS: 
insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested:a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either:their pancreas does not make enough insulintheir cells do not respond to insulin normallyboth of the abovethere aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type:type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.

CHOSEN ANS: 
 because gestational diabetes can hurt you and your baby, you need to start treatment quickly. treatment for gestational diabetes aims to keep blood glucose levels equal to those of pregnant women who don't have gestational diabetes. treatment for gestational diabetes always includes special meal plans and scheduled physical activity. it may also include daily blood glucose testing and insulin injections. if you're testing your blood glucose, the american diabetes association suggests the following targets for women who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. more or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for each individual. before a meal (preprandial): 95 mg/dl or less 1-hour after a meal (postprandial): 140 mg/dl or less 2-hours after a meal (postprandial): 120 mg/dl or less you will need help from your doctor, nurse educator, and other members of your health care team so that your treatment for gestational diabetes can be changed as needed. for you as the mother-to-be, treatment for gestational diabetes helps lower the risk of a cesarean section birth that very large babies may require. sticking with your treatment for gestational diabetes will give you a healthy pregnancy and birth, and may help your baby avoid future poor health.

CHOSEN ANS: 
 over time, high blood glucose from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. the longer you have diabetes, the higher the chances that you will develop heart disease.1 people with diabetes tend to develop heart disease at a younger age than people without diabetes. in adults with diabetes, the most common causes of death are heart disease and stroke. adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die from heart disease or stroke as people without diabetes.2 the good news is that the steps you take to manage your diabetes also help to lower your chances of having heart disease or stroke.

CHOSEN ANS: 
insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested:a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either:their pancreas does not make enough insulintheir cells do not respond to insulin normallyboth of the abovethere aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type:type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.
