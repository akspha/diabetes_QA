CHOSEN ANS: 
 pregnant women who have never had diabetes before but who have high blood glucose (sugar) levels during pregnancy are said to have gestational diabetes. according to a 2014 analysis by the centers for disease control and prevention, the prevalence of gestational diabetes is as high as 9.2%. we don't know what causes gestational diabetes, but we have some clues. the placenta supports the baby as it grows. hormones from the placenta help the baby develop. but these hormones also block the action of the mother's insulin in her body. this problem is called insulin resistance. insulin resistance makes it hard for the mother's body to use insulin. she may need up to three times as much insulin. gestational diabetes starts when your body is not able to make and use all the insulin it needs for pregnancy. without enough insulin, glucose cannot leave the blood and be changed to energy. glucose builds up in the blood to high levels. this is called hyperglycemia. you may also be interested in our book, diabetes & pregnancy: a guide to a healthy pregnancy.

 the kidneys work hard to make up for the failing capillaries so kidney disease produces no symptoms until almost all function is gone. also, the symptoms of kidney disease are not specific. the first symptom of kidney disease is often fluid buildup. other symptoms of kidney disease include loss of sleep, poor appetite, upset stomach, weakness, and difficulty concentrating. it is vital to see a doctor regularly. the doctor can check blood pressure, urine (for protein), blood (for waste products), and organs for other complications of diabetes.

CHOSEN ANS: 
 gestational diabetes affects the mother in late pregnancy, after the baby's body has been formed, but while the baby is busy growing. because of this, gestational diabetes does not cause the kinds of birth defects sometimes seen in babies whose mothers had diabetes before pregnancy. however, untreated or poorly controlled gestational diabetes can hurt your baby. when you have gestational diabetes, your pancreas works overtime to produce insulin, but the insulin does not lower your blood glucose levels. although insulin does not cross the placenta, glucose and other nutrients do. so extra blood glucose goes through the placenta, giving the baby high blood glucose levels. this causes the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin to get rid of the blood glucose. since the baby is getting more energy than it needs to grow and develop, the extra energy is stored as fat. this can lead to macrosomia, or a "fat" baby. babies with macrosomia face health problems of their own, including damage to their shoulders during birth. because of the extra insulin made by the baby's pancreas, newborns may have very low blood glucose levels at birth and are also at higher risk for breathing problems. babies with excess insulin become children who are at risk for obesity and adults who are at risk for type 2 diabetes.

a registered dietitian can help you decide how to balance the carbohydrates, protein, and fat in your diet. here are some general guidelines:the amount of each type of food you eat depends on:your dietyour weighthow often you exerciseyour other health riskseveryone has individual needs. work with your doctor, and possibly a dietitian, to develop a meal plan that works for you.the diabetes food pyramid, which resembles the old usda food guide pyramid, splits foods into six groups in a range of serving sizes. in the diabetes food pyramid, food groups are based on carbohydrate and protein content instead of their food type. a person with diabetes should eat more of the foods in the bottom of the pyramid (grains, beans, vegetables) than those on the top (fats and sweets). this diet will help keep your heart and body systems healthy.another method, similar to the new "plate" usda food guide, encourages larger portions of vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one-quarter of the plate) and starch (one-quarter of the plate).grains, beans, and starchy vegetables(6 or more servings a day)foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are at the bottom of the pyramid because they should serve as the foundation of your diet. as a group, these foods are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.it is important, however, to eat foods with plenty of fiber. choose whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking. choose low-fat breads, such as bagels, tortillas, english muffins, and pita bread.vegetables(3 - 5 servings a day)choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, carrots, and peppers.fruits(2 - 4 servings a day)choose whole fruits more often than juices. whole fruits have more fiber. citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best. drink fruit juices that do not have added sweeteners or syrups.milk(2 - 3 servings a day)choose low-fat or nonfat milk or yogurt. yogurt has natural sugar in it, but it can also contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners. yogurt with artificial sweeteners has fewer calories than yogurt with added sugar.meat and fish(2 - 3 servings a day)eat fish and poultry more often. remove the skin from chicken and turkey. select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. trim all visible fat from meat. bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.fats, alcohol, and sweetsin general, you should limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, cheese, bacon, and butter.if you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar, and to determine a safe amount for you.sweets are high in fat and sugar, so keep portion sizes small. here are some tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.eat sweets that are sugar-free.always ask for the small serving size.learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions.

because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.if you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. you should know the basic steps to diabetes management:how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)how to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)diabetes meal

syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:when they exercisewhen they are sickwhen they will be eating more or less food and calorieswhen they are traveling   diet and exerciseby testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.talk toyour health care provider before

levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.foot carepeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.to prevent problems with your feet:stop smoking if you smoke.improve control of your blood sugar.get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is right for you.preventing complicationsyour doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other

other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:when they exercisewhen they are sickwhen they will be eating more or less food and calorieswhen they are traveling   diet and exerciseby testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.managing your blood sugarchecking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.foot carepeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.to prevent problems with your feet:stop smoking if you smoke.improve control of your blood sugar.get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is right for you.preventing complicationsyour doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. these conditions are called complications of diabetes.
