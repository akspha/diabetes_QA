TARGET:
symptoms gestational
CHOSEN ANS: 
 gestational diabetes affects the mother in late pregnancy, after the baby's body has been formed, but while the baby is busy growing. because of this, gestational diabetes does not cause the kinds of birth defects sometimes seen in babies whose mothers had diabetes before pregnancy. however, untreated or poorly controlled gestational diabetes can hurt your baby. when you have gestational diabetes, your pancreas works overtime to produce insulin, but the insulin does not lower your blood glucose levels. although insulin does not cross the placenta, glucose and other nutrients do. so extra blood glucose goes through the placenta, giving the baby high blood glucose levels. this causes the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin to get rid of the blood glucose. since the baby is getting more energy than it needs to grow and develop, the extra energy is stored as fat. this can lead to macrosomia, or a "fat" baby. babies with macrosomia face health problems of their own, including damage to their shoulders during birth. because of the extra insulin made by the baby's pancreas, newborns may have very low blood glucose levels at birth and are also at higher risk for breathing problems. babies with excess insulin become children who are at risk for obesity and adults who are at risk for type 2 diabetes.

CHOSEN ANS: 
beginning prenatal care early and having regular prenatal visits helps improve your health and the health of your baby. having prenatal screening at 24 - 28 weeks into the pregnancy will help detect gestational diabetes early.if you are overweight, decreasing your body mass index (bmi) to a normal range before you get pregnant will decrease your risk of developing gestational diabetes.

CHOSEN ANS: 
 over time, high blood glucose from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. the longer you have diabetes, the higher the chances that you will develop heart disease.1 people with diabetes tend to develop heart disease at a younger age than people without diabetes. in adults with diabetes, the most common causes of death are heart disease and stroke. adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die from heart disease or stroke as people without diabetes.2 the good news is that the steps you take to manage your diabetes also help to lower your chances of having heart disease or stroke.

CHOSEN ANS: 
insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested:a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either:their pancreas does not make enough insulintheir cells do not respond to insulin normallyboth of the abovethere aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type:type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.

children
CHOSEN ANS: 
until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. it was called juvenile diabetes. with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.but now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes.  type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. but now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are obese, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active, and do not eat well.  to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in childrenhave them maintain a healthy weightbe sure they are physically activehave them eat smaller portions of healthy foodslimit time with the tv, computer, and videochildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. type 2 diabetes may be  controlled with diet and exercise. if not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin.
