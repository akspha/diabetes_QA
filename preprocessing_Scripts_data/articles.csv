2,Abdominal CT scan,4917445,_INTRO_,<p>An abdominal CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the belly area. CT stands for computed tomography.</p>
2,Abdominal CT scan,4917446,How the Test is Performed,"<p>You will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often,you will lie on your back with your arms raised above the head.</p><p>Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern ""spiral"" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.</p><p>A computer creates separate images of the belly area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can bemade by stacking the slices together.</p><p>You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.</p><p>The scan should take less than 30 minutes.</p>"
2,Abdominal CT scan,4917447,How to Prepare for the Test,"<p>You need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.</p><ul><li>Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4-6 hours before the test.</li><li>You may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste although some have flavors so that they taste a little better. </li><li>The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.</li><li>Let your doctor know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.</li><li>Before receiving the contrast, tell your health care provider if you take the diabetes medication metformin(Glucophage).People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.</li></ul><p>Too much weight can damage the scanner. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds. </p><p>You will need to take off yourjewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.</p>"
2,Abdominal CT scan,4917448,How the Test Will Feel,"<p>Lying on the hard table may be a little bit uncomfortable.</p><p>If you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have:</p><ul><li>Slight burning sensation</li><li>Metallic taste in the mouth</li><li>Warm flushing of the body</li></ul><p>These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.</p>"
2,Abdominal CT scan,4917449,Why the Test is Performed,"<p>An abdominal CT scan makesdetailed pictures of the structures inside your belly (abdomen) very quickly.</p><p>This test may be used to look for:</p><ul><li>Cause of abdominal pain or swelling</li><li>Hernia</li><li>Cause of a fever</li><li>Masses and tumors, including cancer</li><li>Infections or injury</li><li>Kidney stones</li><li>Appendicitis</li></ul>"

2,Abdominal CT scan,4917451,Risks,"<p>Risks of CT scans include:</p><ul><li>Allergyto contrast dye</li><li>Exposure to radiation</li></ul><p>CT scansexpose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Talk to your doctor about this risk and the benefit of the test for gettinga correct diagnosis of yourmedical problem. </p><p>Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your doctor know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.</p><ul><li>The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting,sneezing, itching,or hives if you get this type of contrast.</li><li>If you must be given such contrast, your doctor may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.</li><li>Yourkidneys help remove iodine out of the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body if you havekidney disease or diabetes.</li></ul><p>Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test.. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.</p>"

4,Abdominal MRI scan,4917465,How the Test Will Feel,"<p>An MRI exam causes no pain. Youmay get medicine to relax you if you have a problemlying still or are very nervous. Moving too much can blur MRI images and cause errors.</p><p>The table may be hard or cold, but you canask fora blanket or pillow. The machinemakes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.</p><p>An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphonesto help youtime pass.</p><p>There is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.</p>"
4,Abdominal MRI scan,4917466,Why the Test is Performed,"<p>An abdominal MRI provides detailed pictures of the belly area from many views.

7,Abdominal ultrasound,4917487,_INTRO_,"<p>Abdominal ultrasound is an type of imaging test. It is used to examine organs inthe abdomen including the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. The blood vessels that lead to some of these organs can also be looked at with ultrasound.</p>"
7,Abdominal ultrasound,4917488,How the Test is Performed,"<p>An ultrasound machine makes images of organs and structures insidethe body. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves thatreflect off body structures. A computer receives thesewaves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with x-rays or CT scans, this test does not expose you toionizing radiation. </p><p>You will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen.</p><p>You may need tochange position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam.</p><p>Most of the time,the testtakes less than 30 minutes.</p>"
7,Abdominal ultrasound,4917489,How to Prepare for the Test,"<p>Preparation steps vary depending on the problem. Most of the time, people are asked not toeat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do.</p>"
7,Abdominal ultrasound,4917490,How the Test Will Feel,<p>There is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feela littlecold and wet.</p>
7,Abdominal ultrasound,4917491,Why the Test is Performed,<p>You may have this test to: </p><ul><li>Find the cause of abdominal pain</li><li>Find the cause of kidney infections</li><li>Diagnose a hernia</li><li>Diagnose and monitor tumors and cancers</li><li>Diagnose or treat ascites</li><li>Learn why there is swelling of an abdominal organ</li><li>Look for damage after an injury</li><li>Look for stones in the gallbladder or kidney</li><li>Look for the cause of abnormal blood tests such as liver function tests or kidney tests</li><li>Look for the cause of a fever</li></ul><p>The reason for the test will depend on your symptoms.</p>

8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917497,_INTRO_,<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look directly at the contents of a patient's abdomen or pelvis.</p>
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917498,How the Test is Performed,"<p>The procedure is usually done in the hospital or outpatient surgical center under general anesthesia (while you are asleep and pain-free). However, very rarely, this procedure may also be done using local anesthesia. Thisnumbs only the area affected by the surgery and allows you to stay awake.</p><p>A surgeon makes a small cut below the belly button (navel) and inserts a needle into the area. Carbon dioxide gas is passed into the abdomen to expand the area. This gives the surgeon more room to work, and helps the surgeon see the organs more clearly. </p><p>A tube is placed through the cut in your abdomen. A tiny video camera (laparoscope) goes through this tube and is used to see the inside of your pelvis and abdomen. More small cuts may be made if other instruments are needed to get a better view of certain organs.</p><p>If you are having gynecologic laparoscopy, dye may be injected into your cervix area so the surgeon can better see your fallopian tubes.</p><p>After the exam, the gas, laparoscope, and instruments are removed, and the cuts are closed. You will have bandages over those areas.</p>"
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917499,How to Prepare for the Test,<p>Do not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test. You must sign a consent form.</p>
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917500,How the Test Will Feel,"<p>If you are given general anesthesia, you will feel no pain during the procedure.The surgical cuts may throb and be slightly painful afterward. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to relieve pain.</p><p>With local anesthesia, you may feel a prick andburning sensation when the local anesthetic is given. The laparoscope may cause pressure, but there should be no pain during the procedure. </p><p>Afterward, you may also feel soreness at the site of the surgical cut. Your doctor may prescribea pain reliever.</p><p>You may also have shoulder pain for a few days. The gas used during the procedure can irritate the diaphragm, which shares some of the same nerves as the shoulder. You may also have an increased urge to urinate, since the gas can put pressure on the bladder.</p><p>You willrecover for a few hours at the hospital before going home. You will probably not stay overnight after a laparoscopy.</p><p>You will not be allowed to drive home. Someone should be available to pick you up after the procedure.</p>"
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917501,Why the Test is Performed,"<p>Diagnostic laparoscopy helps identify the cause of pain or a growth in the abdomen and pelvic area. It is doneif x-rays or ultrasound results are unclear.</p><p>The procedure may also be done instead of open surgery after an accident to see if there is any injury to the abdomen.</p><p>Laparoscopy may be done before proceduresto treat cancer (such as surgery to remove an organ), to find out whether the cancer has spread. If it has spread, treatmentwill change.</p>"
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917502,Normal Results,"<p>There is no blood in the abdomen, no hernias, no intestinal obstruction, and no cancer in any visible organs. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are of normal size, shape, and color. The liver is normal.</p>"
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917503,What Abnormal Results Mean,"<p>Abnormal results may be due to a number of different conditions, including:</p><ul><li>Adhesions</li><li>Appendicitis</li><li>Endometriosis</li><li>Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis)</li><li>Ovarian cysts or cancer of the ovary</li><li>Pelvic inflammatory disease</li><li>Signs of injury</li><li>Spread of cancer</li><li>Tumors</li><li>Uterine fibroids</li></ul>"
8,Diagnostic laparoscopy,4917504,Risks,"<p>There is some risk of infection. You may get antibiotics to prevent this complication.</p><p>There is a risk of puncturing an organ, which could cause the contents of the intestines to leak. There may also be bleeding into the abdominal cavity.These complications could lead to immediate open surgery (laparotomy).</p><p>Diagnostic laparoscopy may not be possible if you have a swollen bowel, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), or you've had a past surgery.</p>"

10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917515,_INTRO_,<p>Intestinal ischemia and infarction is damage to (ischemia) or death of (infarction) part of the intestine due to a decrease in its blood supply.</p>
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917516,Causes,"<p>There are several possible causes of intestinal ischemia and infarction.</p><p>Hernia: If the intestine moves into the wrong place or becomes tangled, this can lead to intestinal ischemia.</p><p>Adhesions: The intestine may become trapped in scar tissue from past surgery (adhesions). This can lead to ischemia if left untreated.</p><p>Embolus: A blood clot from the heart or main blood vessels may travel through the bloodstream and block one of the arteries supplying the intestine. People who have had a heart attack or who havearrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, are at risk for this problem.</p><p>Arterial thrombosis: The arteries that supply blood to the intestine may become so narrowed from atherosclerotic disease (cholesterol buildup) that they become blocked. When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack. When it happens in the arteries to the intestine, it causes intestinal ischemia.</p><p>Venous thrombosis: The veins carrying blood away from the intestines may become blocked by blood clots. This blocks blood flow into the intestines. This is more common in people with liver disease, cancer, or blood clotting disorders.</p><p>Low blood pressure: Very low blood pressure in patients who already have narrowing of the intestinal arteries may also cause intestinal ischemia. This typically occurs in patients who are very ill for other reasons. It can be compared to losing water pressure in a hose with a partial blockage.</p>"
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917517,Symptoms,<p>The hallmark symptom of intestinal ischemia is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Fever</li><li>Vomiting</li></ul>
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917518,Exams and Tests,"<p>Laboratory tests may show a high white blood cell (WBC) count (a marker of infection) and increased acid in the bloodstream. There may be bleeding in the GI tract.</p><p>Other tests include:</p><ul><li>Angiogram</li><li>CT scan of the abdomen</li><li>Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen</li></ul><p>None of these tests are foolproof, however. Sometimes the only sure way to diagnose intestinal ischemia is with a surgical procedure.</p>"
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917519,Treatment,"<p>Treatment usually requires surgery. The section of intestine that has died is removed, and the healthy remaining ends of bowel reconnected.</p><p>In some cases, a colostomy or ileostomy is needed.The blockage of arteriesto the intestine is corrected, if possible.</p>"
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917520,Outlook (Prognosis),<p>Intestinal ischemia is a serious condition that can result in death if not treated promptly. The outlook depends on the cause. A good outcome may be achieved with prompt treatment.</p>
10,Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,4917521,Possible Complications,"<p>Intestinal infarction may require a colostomy or ileostomy, which may be short-term or permanent. Peritonitis is common inthese cases.</p><p>Some people may develop severe illness, with fever and a bloodstream infection (sepsis).</p>"

11,Intussusception - children,4917526,_INTRO_,<p>Intussusception is the sliding of one part of the intestine into another.</p><p>This article focuses on intussusception in children.</p>
11,Intussusception - children,4917527,Causes,"<p>Intussusception is caused by part of the intestine being pulled inward into itself. This can block the passage of food through the intestine. If the blood supply is cut off, the segment of intestine pulled inside can die.</p><p>The pressure created by the walls of the intestine pressing together causes:</p><ul><li>Decreased blood flow</li><li>Irritation</li><li>Swelling</li></ul><p>The intestine can die, and the patient can have significant bleeding. If a hole occurs, infection, shock, and dehydration can take place very rapidly.</p><p>The cause of intussusception is not known, although viral infections may be responsible in some cases. Sometimes a lymph node, polyp, or tumor can trigger the problem. The older the child, the more likely such a trigger will be found.</p><p>Intussusception can affect both children and adults, although most cases occur in children ages 6 months - 2 years. It affects boys four times as often as girls.</p>"
11,Intussusception - children,4917528,Symptoms,"<p>The first sign of intussusception is usually sudden, loud crying caused by abdominal pain. The pain is colicky and not continuous (intermittent), but it comes back often, increasing in both intensity and duration.</p><p>An infant with severe abdominal pain may draw the knees to the chest while crying.</p><p>Other symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Bloody, mucus-like bowel movement, sometimes called a ""currant jelly"" stool</li><li>Fever</li><li>Shock (pale color, lethargy, sweating)</li><li>Stool mixed with blood and mucus</li><li>Vomiting</li></ul>"
11,Intussusception - children,4917529,Exams and Tests,"<p>Your doctor will perform a thorough examination, which may reveal a mass in the abdomen. There may also be signs of dehydration or shock.</p><p>Tests may include:</p><ul><li>Abdominal x-ray</li><li>Air or contrast enema</li></ul>"
11,Intussusception - children,4917530,Treatment,"<p>The child will first be stabilized. A tube will be passed into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in the arm, and fluids will be given to prevent dehydration.</p><p>In some cases, the bowel obstruction can be treated with an air or contrast enema performed by a skilled radiologist. There is a risk of bowel tearing (perforation) with this procedure, and it is not used if the bowel has already developed a hole.</p><p>If these treatments are unsuccessful, the child will need surgery. The bowel tissue can usually be saved, but any dead tissue will be removed.</p><p>Intravenous feeding and fluids will be continued until the child has a normal bowel movement.</p>"
11,Intussusception - children,4917531,Outlook (Prognosis),<p>The outcome is good with early treatment. There is a risk the condition will come back.</p>
11,Intussusception - children,4917532,Possible Complications,"<p>A hole (perforation) is a serious complication due to risk of infection. If not treated, intussusception is almost always fatal for infants and young children.</p>"

12,Mittelschmerz,4917536,Causes,"<p>About 1 in 5 women have pain around the time of ovulation. This is called mittelschmerz. The pain may occur just before, during, or after ovulation.</p><p>This pain can be explained in several ways. Just before to ovulation, the growth of the follicle where the egg develops may stretch the surface of the ovary. This can cause pain. At the time of ovulation, fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This may irritate lining of the abdomen.</p>"
12,Mittelschmerz,4917537,Symptoms,"<p>Mittelschmerz may be felt on one side of the body in one month and then switch to the other side in the next month.

1823,Diabetes,4932162,_INTRO_,<p>Diabetes is usually a lifelong (chronic) disease in which thereis ahigh level of sugar in the blood.</p>
1823,Diabetes,4932163,Causes,"<p>Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.</p><p>To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:</p><ul><li>A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul><p>People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. This is because either:</p><ul><li>Their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>Their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>Both of the above</li></ul><p>There aretwo major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:</p><ul><li>Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.</li><li>Type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. It most often occurs in adulthood.But because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>There are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul><p>Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.</p><p>Diabetes affects more than 20 million Americans. Over 40 million Americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). If your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.</p>"
1823,Diabetes,4932164,Symptoms,"<p>High blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:</p><ul><li>Blurry vision</li><li>Excess thirst</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Hunger</li><li>Urinating often</li><li>Weight loss</li></ul><p>Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.</p><p>After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications and include:</p><ul><li>Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, blindness in the future</li><li>Painful sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if left untreated, leads to removal of the foot or leg </li><li>Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, tingling, and a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, erectile dysfunction</li><li>Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure</li><li>Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections</li><li>Increased chance of having a heart attackor stroke</li></ul>"
1823,Diabetes,4932165,Exams and Tests,"<p>A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.</p><p>Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.</p><p>Blood tests:</p><ul><li>Fasting blood glucose level -- diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL twice. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL are called impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Hemoglobin A1c test -- <ul><li>Normal: Less than 5.7%</li><li>Pre-diabetes: 5.7% - 6.4%</li><li>Diabetes: 6.5% or higher</li></ul></li><li>Oral glucose tolerance test -- diabetes is diagnosed if glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL 2 hoursafter drinking a glucose drink. (This test is used more often for type 2 diabetes.)</li></ul><p>Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:</p><ul><li>Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 years</li><li>Overweight adults (BMI greater than 25) who have other risk factors</li><li>Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years</li></ul>"
1823,Diabetes,4932166,Treatment,"<p>Withtype 2 diabetes,the disease may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight through exercising and eating healthier foods. Also, some cases of type 2 diabetes can be improved with weight-loss surgery.</p><p>There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. </p><p>Treating both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.</p><p>Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.</p><p>To prevent diabetes complications, visit your health care provider at least two to four times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your health care provider's instructions on managing your diabetes.</p>"

1834,Diabetes diet - gestational,4932261,Recommendations,"<p>The best way to improve your diet is by eating a variety of healthy foods. </p><p>You should learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions. </p><p>Talk to your doctor or dietitian if you are a vegetarian or on some other special diet.</p><p>In general, your diet should be: </p><ul><li>Moderate in fat and protein</li><li>Provide controlled levels of carbohydrates through foods including fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice)</li><li>Lower in foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries</li></ul><p>You will be asked to eat three small- to moderate- sized meals and one or more snacks each day. Do not skip meals and snacks. Keep the amount and types of food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) the same from day to day.</p><p>CARBOHYDRATES</p><ul><li>Carbohydrates should make up less than half of the calories you eat.</li><li>Most carbohydrates are found in starchy or sugary foods, such as bread, rice, pasta, cereal, potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, cookies, candy, soda, and other sweets.</li><li>High-fiber, whole-grain carbohydrates are healthier choices.</li><li>Vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, and spinach) add much more to your health than to your blood sugar. Enjoy lots of them.</li><li>Carbohydrates in food are measured in grams. You can learn to count the carbohydrates in the foods that you like and that you eat.</li></ul><p>GRAINS, BEANS, AND STARTCHY VEGETABLES</p><ul><li>Eat 6 or more servings a day: one serving equals 1 slice bread, 1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal, 1/2 cup cooked rice or pasta, or 1 English muffin.</li><li>Foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.</li><li>Choosecarbohydrate sources with plenty of fiber. Eat whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. Use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking.</li><li>Eat more low-fat breads, such as tortillas, English muffins, and pita bread.</li></ul><p>VEGETABLES</p><ul><li>Eat 3 - 5 servings a day: one serving equals 1 cup leafy, green vegetables; 1 cup cooked or chopped raw leafy vegetables; 3/4 cup vegetable juice; or 1/2 cup of chopped vegetables, cooked or raw.</li><li>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. You should opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine, carrots, and peppers.</li></ul><p>FRUITS</p><ul><li>Eat 2 - 4 servings a day: one serving equals 1 medium whole fruit (such as a banana, apple, or orange); 1/2 cup chopped, frozen, cooked, or canned fruit; or 3/4 cup fruit juice.</li><li>Choose whole fruits more often than juices. They have more fiber. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best.

1835,Gestational diabetes,4932265,Causes,"<p>Pregnancy hormones can block insulin from doing its job.

1835,Gestational diabetes,4932266,Symptoms,"<p>Usually there are no symptoms, or the symptoms are mild and not life threatening to the pregnant woman. The blood sugar (glucose) level usually returns to normal after delivery.</p><p>Symptoms may include:</p><ul><li>Blurred vision</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Frequent infections, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin</li><li>Increased thirst</li><li>Increased urination</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Weight loss despite increased appetite</li></ul>"
1835,Gestational diabetes,4932267,Exams and Tests,"<p>Gestational diabetes usually starts halfway through the pregnancy. All pregnant women should receive an oral glucose tolerance test between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy to screen for the condition. Women who have risk factors for gestational diabetes may have this test earlier in the pregnancy.</p><p>Once you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you can see how well you are doing by testing your glucose level at home. The most common way involves pricking your finger and putting a drop of your blood on a machine that will give you a glucose reading.</p>"
1835,Gestational diabetes,4932268,Treatment,"<p>The goals of treatment are to keep blood sugar (glucose) levels within normal limits during the pregnancy, and to make sure that the growing baby is healthy.</p><p>WATCHING YOUR BABY</p><p>Your health care provider should closely check both you and your baby throughout the pregnancy.

1835,Gestational diabetes,4932269,Outlook (Prognosis),"<p>Most women with gestational diabetes are able to control their blood sugar and avoid harm to themselves or their baby.</p><p>Pregnant women with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies at birth. This can increase the chance of problems at the time of delivery, including:</p><ul><li>Birth injury (trauma) because of the baby's large size</li><li>Delivery by c-section</li></ul><p>Your baby is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the first few days of life.</p><p>Mothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy.</p><p>There is a slightly increased risk of the baby dying when the mother has untreated gestational diabetes. Controlling blood sugar levels reduces this risk.</p><p>High blood sugar (glucose) levels often go back to normal after delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth and at regular doctor's appointments to screen for signs of diabetes.

1846,Diabetes in Children and Teens,4932367,_INTRO_,"<p>Until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.</p><p>But now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.</p><p>Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are obese, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active, and do not eat well.  To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children</p><ul><li>Have them maintain a healthy weight</li><li>Be sure they are physically active</li><li>Have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods</li><li>Limit time with the TV, computer, and video</li></ul><p>Children and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be  controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin.</p>"
1847,Diabetes,4932368,_INTRO_,<p>Diabetes is usually a lifelong (chronic) disease in which thereis ahigh level of sugar in the blood.</p>
1847,Diabetes,4932369,Causes,"<p>Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.</p><p>To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:</p><ul><li>A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul><p>People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. This is because either:</p><ul><li>Their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>Their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>Both of the above</li></ul><p>There aretwo major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:</p><ul><li>Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.</li><li>Type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. It most often occurs in adulthood.But because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>There are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul><p>Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.</p><p>Diabetes affects more than 20 million Americans. Over 40 million Americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). If your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.</p>"
1847,Diabetes,4932370,Symptoms,"<p>High blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:</p><ul><li>Blurry vision</li><li>Excess thirst</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Hunger</li><li>Urinating often</li><li>Weight loss</li></ul><p>Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.</p><p>After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications and include:</p><ul><li>Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, blindness in the future</li><li>Painful sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if left untreated, leads to removal of the foot or leg </li><li>Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, tingling, and a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, erectile dysfunction</li><li>Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure</li><li>Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections</li><li>Increased chance of having a heart attackor stroke</li></ul>"
1847,Diabetes,4932371,Exams and Tests,"<p>A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.</p><p>Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.</p><p>Blood tests:</p><ul><li>Fasting blood glucose level -- diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL twice. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL are called impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Hemoglobin A1c test -- <ul><li>Normal: Less than 5.7%</li><li>Pre-diabetes: 5.7% - 6.4%</li><li>Diabetes: 6.5% or higher</li></ul></li><li>Oral glucose tolerance test -- diabetes is diagnosed if glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL 2 hoursafter drinking a glucose drink. (This test is used more often for type 2 diabetes.)</li></ul><p>Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:</p><ul><li>Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 years</li><li>Overweight adults (BMI greater than 25) who have other risk factors</li><li>Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years</li></ul>"
1847,Diabetes,4932372,Treatment,"<p>Withtype 2 diabetes,the disease may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight through exercising and eating healthier foods. Also, some cases of type 2 diabetes can be improved with weight-loss surgery.</p><p>There is no cure for type 1 diabetes. </p><p>Treating both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.</p><p>Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.</p><p>To prevent diabetes complications, visit your health care provider at least two to four times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your health care provider's instructions on managing your diabetes.</p>"

1848,Diabetes type 2 - meal planning,4932376,_INTRO_,"<p>When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar and weight.</p>"
1848,Diabetes type 2 - meal planning,4932377,Function,"<p>Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range.To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:</p><ul><li>Food from all the food groups</li><li>Fewer calories</li><li>About the same amount of carbohydratesat each meal and snack</li><li>Healthy fats</li></ul><p>Along with healthy eating, you can keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. </p><p>HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR</p><p>Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.</p><p>The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range.</p><p>MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES</p><p>Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day).</p><p>Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.</p><p>The following tips can help your child stay on track:</p><ul><li>No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your childs blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range.</li><li>Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.</li><li>Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. </li></ul><p>PLANNING MEALS</p><p>Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.</p><p>When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.</p><p>A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate.</p><p>EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS</p><p>Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. </p><p>VEGETABLES (2 to 3 cups a day)</p><p>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, potatoes, and taro.</p><p>FRUITS (1 to 2 cups a day)</p><p>Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar), or dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.</p><p>GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces a day)</p><p>There are two types of grains:</p><ul><li>Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.</li><li>Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.</li></ul><p>Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. So, for healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. </p><p>PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6 ounces a day)</p><p>Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods.Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.</p><p>DAIRY (3 cups a day)</p><p>Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. <br><br>OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons a day)</p><p>Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.</p><p>Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. </p><p>Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.</p><p>Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons.</p><p>WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?</p><p>If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal.

1848,Diabetes type 2 - meal planning,4932378,Recommendations,"<p>A registered dietitian can help you decide how to balance the carbohydrates, protein, and fat in your diet. Here are some general guidelines:</p><p>The amount of each type of food you eat depends on:</p><ul><li>Your diet</li><li>Your weight</li><li>How often you exercise</li><li>Your other health risks</li></ul><p>Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, and possibly a dietitian, to develop a meal plan that works for you.</p><p>The Diabetes Food Pyramid, which resembles the old USDA food guide pyramid, splits foods into six groups in a range of serving sizes. In the Diabetes Food Pyramid, food groups are based on carbohydrate and protein content instead of their food type. A person with diabetes should eat more of the foods in the bottom of the pyramid (grains, beans, vegetables) than those on the top (fats and sweets). This diet will help keep your heart and body systems healthy.</p><p>Another method, similar to the new ""plate"" USDA food guide, encourages larger portions of vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one-quarter of the plate) and starch (one-quarter of the plate).</p><p>GRAINS, BEANS, AND STARCHY VEGETABLES</p><p>(6 or more servings a day)</p><p>Foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are at the bottom of the pyramid because they should serve as the foundation of your diet. As a group, these foods are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.</p><p>It is important, however, to eat foods with plenty of fiber. Choose whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. Use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking. Choose low-fat breads, such as bagels, tortillas, English muffins, and pita bread.</p><p>VEGETABLES</p><p>(3 - 5 servings a day)</p><p>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, carrots, and peppers.</p><p>FRUITS</p><p>(2 - 4 servings a day)</p><p>Choose whole fruits more often than juices. Whole fruits have more fiber. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best. Drink fruit juices that do NOT have added sweeteners or syrups.</p><p>MILK</p><p>(2 - 3 servings a day)</p><p>Choose low-fat or nonfat milk or yogurt. Yogurt has natural sugar in it, but it can also contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners. Yogurt with artificial sweeteners has fewer calories than yogurt with added sugar.</p><p>MEAT AND FISH</p><p>(2 - 3 servings a day)</p><p>Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.</p><p>FATS, ALCOHOL, AND SWEETS</p><p>In general, you should limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, cheese, bacon, and butter.</p><p>If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar, and to determine a safe amount for you.</p><p>Sweets are high in fat and sugar, so keep portion sizes small. Here are some tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:</p><ul><li>Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.</li><li>Eat sweets that are sugar-free.</li><li>Always ask for the small serving size.</li></ul><p>Learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions.</p>"

1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932488,_INTRO_,<p>Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which thereisahigh level of sugar (glucose) in the blood.</p>
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932489,Causes,"<p>Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.</p><p>Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. There, it is stored and later used for energy. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin.</p><p>Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. The body is unable to use this glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Most likely it is an autoimmune disorder.This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes can be passed down through families.</p>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932490,Symptoms,"<p><em>High Blood Sugar</em></p><p>These symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes, or they may occur when blood sugar is high:</p><ul><li>Being very thirsty</li><li>Feeling hungry</li><li>Feeling tired all the time  </li><li>Having blurry eyesight</li><li>Feeling numbnessor feeling tingling in your feet</li><li>Losing weight without trying</li><li>Urinating more often</li></ul><p>For other people, these serious warning symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes, or they may happen when blood sugar is very high (diabetic ketoacidosis):</p><ul><li>Deep, rapid breathing</li><li>Dry skin and mouth</li><li>Flushed face</li><li>Fruity breath odor</li><li>Nausea or vomiting, inability to keep down fluids</li><li>Stomach pain</li></ul><p><em>Low Blood Sugar</em></p><p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can develop quickly in people with diabetes who are taking insulin. Symptoms usually appear when blood sugar level falls below 70 mg/dL. Watch for:</p><ul><li>Headache</li><li>Hunger</li><li>Nervousness</li><li>Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)</li><li>Shaking</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Weakness</li></ul>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932491,Exams and Tests,"<p>Diabetes is diagnosed with the following blood tests:</p><ul><li>Fasting blood glucose level -- diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL two times</li><li>Random (nonfasting) blood glucose level -- you may have diabetes if it is higher than 200 mg/dL, and you have symptoms such as increased thirst, urination, and fatigue (this must be confirmed with a fasting test)</li><li>Oral glucose tolerance test -- diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL 2 hours after drinking a special sugar drink</li><li>Hemoglobin A1C test -- 6.5% or higher </li></ul><p>Ketone testing is also sometimes used. The ketone test is done using a urine sample or blood sample. Ketone testing may be done:</p><ul><li>When the blood sugar is higher than 240 mg/dL</li><li>During an illness such as pneumonia, heart attack, or stroke</li><li>When nausea or vomiting occur</li><li>During pregnancy</li></ul><p>The following tests or exams will help you and your doctor monitor your diabetes and prevent problems caused by diabetes:</p><ul><li>Check the skin and bones on your feet and legs.</li><li>Check to see if your feet are getting numb.</li><li>Have your blood pressure checked at least every year (blood pressure goal should be 140/80 mm/Hg or lower).</li><li>Have yourA1C test (Hemoglobin A1C) done every 6 months if your diabetes is well controlled; otherwise, every 3 months.</li><li>Have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked yearly (aim for LDL cholesterol levels below 70-100 mg/dL).</li><li>Get yearly tests to make sure your kidneys are working well (microalbuminuria and serum creatinine).</li><li>Visit your eye doctor at least once a year, or more often if you have signs of diabetic eye disease.</li><li>See the dentist every 6 months for a thorough dental cleaning and exam. Make sure your dentist and hygienist know that you have diabetes.</li></ul>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932492,Treatment,"<p>Because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>If you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. Your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. Your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. It may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>As the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. Visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>You are the most important person in managing your diabetes. You should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>How to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>How to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>Diabetes meal planning</li><li>How to give insulin</li><li>How to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>How to adjust insulin and food when you exercise</li><li>How to handle sick days</li><li>Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>INSULIN</p><p>Insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. Everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>Insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. The health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.Sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. Other types of insulin should never be mixed. You may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>Your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. At first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. By age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>People with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>When they exercise</li><li>When they are sick</li><li>When they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>When they are traveling</li></ul><p>   DIET AND EXERCISE</p><p>By testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. This helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>The American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. It can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>Regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. It also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>Talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR</p><p>Checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>To check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. The numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. You and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. You should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. Blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dL are too low and can harm you.</p><p>FOOT CARE</p><p>People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.</p><p>To prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>Stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>Improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>Get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.</li><li>Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.</li><li>Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul><p>PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. These conditions are called complications of diabetes.</p>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932493,Support Groups,<p>There are many diabetes resources that can help you understand more about type 1 diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your condition so that you can live well with diabetes.</p>
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932494,Outlook (Prognosis),"<p>Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure.</p><p>Tight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problemscan occur, even in people with good diabetes control.</p>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932495,Possible Complications,"<p>After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems:</p><ul><li>You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night) and sensitivity to light. You could become blind.</li><li>Your feet and skin could develop sores and infections. If you have these sores for too long, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching.</li><li>Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to the legs and feet.</li><li>Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.</li><li>Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can also make it harder for men to have an erection.</li><li>High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. The kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.</li></ul>"
1860,Type 1 diabetes,4932496,When to Contact a Medical Professional,"<p>Call 911 if you have:</p><ul><li>Chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or other signs of angina</li><li>Loss of consciousness</li><li>Seizures</li></ul><p>Call your health care provider or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>Also call your doctor if you have:</p><ul><li>Blood sugar levels that are higher than the goals you and your doctor have set</li><li>Numbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legs</li><li>Problems with your eyesight</li><li>Sores or infections on your feet</li><li>Symptoms that your blood sugar is getting too low (feeling weak or tired, trembling, sweating, feeling irritable, having trouble thinking clearly, fast heartbeat, double or blurry vision, feeling uneasy)</li><li>Symptoms that your blood sugar is too high (being very thirsty, having blurry vision, having dry skin, feeling weak or tired, needing to urinate a lot)</li><li>You are having blood sugar readings below 70 mg/dL</li></ul><p>You can treat early signs of hypoglycemia at home by eating sugar or candy, or by taking glucose tablets. If signs of hypoglycemia continue or your blood glucose level stays below 60 mg/dL, go to the hospital emergency room.</p>"

1862,Diabetes Insipidus,4932512,_INTRO_,"<p>Diabetes insipidus (DI) causes frequent urination. You become extremely thirsty, so you drink. Then you urinate. This cycle can keep you from sleeping or even make you wet the bed. Your body produces lots of urine that is almost all water.</p><p>DI is different from diabetes mellitus (DM), which involves insulin problems and high blood sugar. The symptoms can be similar. However, DI is related to how your kidneys handle fluids. It's much less common than DM. Urine and blood tests can show which one you have.</p><p>Usually, DI is caused by a problem with your pituitary gland or your kidneys. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem.  Medicines can often help.</p><p>NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>"
1864,Diabetes insipidus,4932523,_INTRO_,<p>Diabetes insipidus is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water.</p>
1864,Diabetes insipidus,4932524,Causes,"<p>During the day, your kidneys filter all your blood many times. Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine is excreted. DI occurs when the kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted. </p><p>The amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain.</p><p>DI caused by a lack of ADH is called central diabetes insipidus. When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.</p><p>Central diabetes insipidus can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland as a result of:</p><ul><li>Genetic problems</li><li>Head injury</li><li>Infection</li><li>Loss of blood supply to the gland</li><li>Surgery</li><li>Tumor </li></ul><p>Nephrogenic DI involves a defect in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys do not respond to ADH. Like central DI, nephrogenic DI is very rare. Nephrogenic DI may be caused by:</p><ul><li>Certain drugs (such as lithium)</li><li>Genetic problems</li><li>High level of calcium in the body (hypercalcemia)</li><li>Kidney disease (such as polycystic kidney disease) </li></ul>"
1864,Diabetes insipidus,4932525,Symptoms,"<p>Symptoms of DI include: </p><ul><li>Excessive thirst that may be intense or uncontrollable, usually with the need to drink large amounts of water or craving for ice water</li><li>Excessive urine volume</li><li>Excessive urination, often needing to urinate every hour throughout the day and night </li></ul>"
1864,Diabetes insipidus,4932526,Exams and Tests,<p>The health care provider will ask about your medical history and symptoms.</p><p>Tests that may be ordered include:</p><ul><li>Blood sodium and osmolarity</li><li>Desmopressin (DDAVP) challenge</li><li>MRI of the head</li><li>Urinalysis</li><li>Urine concentration</li><li>Urine output </li></ul>
1864,Diabetes insipidus,4932527,Treatment,"<p>The cause of the underlying condition will be treated when possible.</p><p>Central diabetes insipidus may be controlled with vasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP). You take vasopressin as either an injection, a nasal spray, or tablets.</p><p>If nephrogenic DI is caused by medication, stopping the medication may help restore normal kidney function. But with some medications, such as lithium, after many years of use, nephrogenic DI can be permanent.</p><p>Hereditary nephrogenic DI and lithium-induced nephrogenic DI are treated by drinking enough fluids to match urine output. Medicines that lower urine output also need to be taken. </p><p>Nephrogenic DI is treated with anti-inflammatory medicines and diuretics (water pills).</p>"

1866,Diabetes insipidus - nephrogenic,4932543,_INTRO_,"<p>Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder in which a defect in the small tubes (tubules) in the kidneys causes a person to pass a large amount of urine.
