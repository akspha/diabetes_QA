1823,Diabetes,4932163,Causes,"<p>Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.</p><p>To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:</p><ul><li>A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul><p>People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. This is because either:</p><ul><li>Their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>Their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>Both of the above</li></ul><p>There aretwo major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:</p><ul><li>Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.</li><li>Type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. It most often occurs in adulthood.But because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>There are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul><p>Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.</p><p>Diabetes affects more than 20 million Americans. Over 40 million Americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). If your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.</p>"
1823,Diabetes,4932164,Symptoms,"<p>High blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:</p><ul><li>Blurry vision</li><li>Excess thirst</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Hunger</li><li>Urinating often</li><li>Weight loss</li></ul><p>Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.</p><p>After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications and include:</p><ul><li>Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, blindness in the future</li><li>Painful sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if left untreated, leads to removal of the foot or leg </li><li>Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, tingling, and a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, erectile dysfunction</li><li>Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure</li><li>Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections</li><li>Increased chance of having a heart attackor stroke</li></ul>"

1834,"Diabetes diet - gestational",4932261,Recommendations,"<p>The best way to improve your diet is by eating a variety of healthy foods. </p><p>You should learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions. </p><p>Talk to your doctor or dietitian if you are a vegetarian or on some other special diet.</p><p>In general, your diet should be: </p><ul><li>Moderate in fat and protein</li><li>Provide controlled levels of carbohydrates through foods including fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice)</li><li>Lower in foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries</li></ul><p>You will be asked to eat three small- to moderate- sized meals and one or more snacks each day. Do not skip meals and snacks. Keep the amount and types of food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) the same from day to day.</p><p>CARBOHYDRATES</p><ul><li>Carbohydrates should make up less than half of the calories you eat.</li><li>Most carbohydrates are found in starchy or sugary foods, such as bread, rice, pasta, cereal, potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, cookies, candy, soda, and other sweets.</li><li>High-fiber, whole-grain carbohydrates are healthier choices.</li><li>Vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, and spinach) add much more to your health than to your blood sugar. Enjoy lots of them.</li><li>Carbohydrates in food are measured in grams. You can learn to count the carbohydrates in the foods that you like and that you eat.</li></ul><p>GRAINS, BEANS, AND STARTCHY VEGETABLES</p><ul><li>Eat 6 or more servings a day: one serving equals 1 slice bread, 1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal, 1/2 cup cooked rice or pasta, or 1 English muffin.</li><li>Foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.</li><li>Choosecarbohydrate sources with plenty of fiber. Eat whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. Use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking.</li><li>Eat more low-fat breads, such as tortillas, English muffins, and pita bread.</li></ul><p>VEGETABLES</p><ul><li>Eat 3 - 5 servings a day: one serving equals 1 cup leafy, green vegetables; 1 cup cooked or chopped raw leafy vegetables; 3/4 cup vegetable juice; or 1/2 cup of chopped vegetables, cooked or raw.</li><li>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. You should opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine, carrots, and peppers.</li></ul><p>FRUITS</p><ul><li>Eat 2 - 4 servings a day: one serving equals 1 medium whole fruit (such as a banana, apple, or orange); 1/2 cup chopped, frozen, cooked, or canned fruit; or 3/4 cup fruit juice.</li><li>Choose whole fruits more often than juices. They have more fiber. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best. Opt for fruit juices without added sweeteners or syrups.</li><li>Choose fresh fruits and juices, which retain more of their nutritional value than frozen or canned varieties.</li></ul><p>MILK AND DAIRY</p><ul><li>Eat 4 servings a day: one serving equals 1 cup milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 oz. natural cheese, or 2 oz. processed cheese.</li><li>Choose low-fat or nonfat milk or yogurt. Yogurt has natural sugar in it, but avoid yogurt with added sugar or artificial sweeteners.</li><li>Dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus (to keep calories and cholesterol in check, though, choose low-fat dairy products).</li></ul><p>PROTEIN (MEAT, FISH, DRY BEANS, EGGS, AND NUTS)</p><ul><li>Eat 2 - 3 servings a day: one serving equals 2-3 oz. cooked meat, poultry, or fish; 1/2 cup cooked beans; 1 egg; or 2 tablespoons peanut butter</li><li>Choose fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork or wild game.</li><li>Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.</li><li>Foods from this group are excellent sources of B vitamins, protein, iron, and zinc.</li></ul><p>SWEETS</p><ul><li>Sweets are high in fat and sugar, so keep portion sizes small.</li><li>Eat sweets that are sugar-free.</li><li>Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.</li></ul><p>FATS</p><ul><li>Go easy on butter, margarine, salad dressing, cooking oil, and desserts. But don't cut fats and oils from your diet entirely. They provide long-term energy for growth and are essential for brain development.</li><li>In general, you should limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat such as hamburger, cheese, bacon, and butter.</li></ul><p>OTHER LIFESTYLE CHANGES</p><p>Your doctor may also suggest a safe exercise plan. Walking is usually the easiest type of exercise, but swimming or other low-impact exercises can work just as well. Exercise is an important way to keep blood sugar in control.</p>"

Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. </p><p>HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR</p><p>Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.</p><p>The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range.</p><p>MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES</p><p>Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day).</p><p>Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.</p><p>The following tips can help your child stay on track:</p><ul><li>No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your childs blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range.</li><li>Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.</li><li>Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk. </li></ul><p>PLANNING MEALS</p><p>Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.</p><p>When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.</p><p>A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate.</p><p>EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS</p><p>Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. </p><p>VEGETABLES (2 to 3 cups a day)</p><p>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, potatoes, and taro.</p><p>FRUITS (1 to 2 cups a day)</p><p>Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar), or dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.</p><p>GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces a day)</p><p>There are two types of grains:</p><ul><li>Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.</li><li>Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.</li></ul><p>Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. So, for healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast. </p><p>PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6 ounces a day)</p><p>Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods.Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.</p><p>DAIRY (3 cups a day)</p><p>Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. <br><br>OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons a day)</p><p>Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.</p><p>Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter. </p><p>Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.</p><p>Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons.</p><p>WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?</p><p>If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.</p><p>Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small. </p><p>Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:</p><ul><li>Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.</li><li>Eat sweets that are sugar-free.</li><li>Always ask for the smallest serving size or childrens size.</li></ul>"
1848,"Diabetes type 2 - meal planning",4932378,Recommendations,"<p>A registered dietitian can help you decide how to balance the carbohydrates, protein, and fat in your diet. Here are some general guidelines:</p><p>The amount of each type of food you eat depends on:</p><ul><li>Your diet</li><li>Your weight</li><li>How often you exercise</li><li>Your other health risks</li></ul><p>Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, and possibly a dietitian, to develop a meal plan that works for you.</p><p>The Diabetes Food Pyramid, which resembles the old USDA food guide pyramid, splits foods into six groups in a range of serving sizes. In the Diabetes Food Pyramid, food groups are based on carbohydrate and protein content instead of their food type. A person with diabetes should eat more of the foods in the bottom of the pyramid (grains, beans, vegetables) than those on the top (fats and sweets). This diet will help keep your heart and body systems healthy.</p><p>Another method, similar to the new ""plate"" USDA food guide, encourages larger portions of vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one-quarter of the plate) and starch (one-quarter of the plate).</p><p>GRAINS, BEANS, AND STARCHY VEGETABLES</p><p>(6 or more servings a day)</p><p>Foods like bread, grains, beans, rice, pasta, and starchy vegetables are at the bottom of the pyramid because they should serve as the foundation of your diet. As a group, these foods are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates.</p><p>It is important, however, to eat foods with plenty of fiber. Choose whole-grain foods such as whole-grain bread or crackers, tortillas, bran cereal, brown rice, or beans. Use whole-wheat or other whole-grain flours in cooking and baking. Choose low-fat breads, such as bagels, tortillas, English muffins, and pita bread.</p><p>VEGETABLES</p><p>(3 - 5 servings a day)</p><p>Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Opt for more dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, carrots, and peppers.</p><p>FRUITS</p><p>(2 - 4 servings a day)</p><p>Choose whole fruits more often than juices. Whole fruits have more fiber. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines, are best. Drink fruit juices that do NOT have added sweeteners or syrups.</p><p>MILK</p><p>(2 - 3 servings a day)</p><p>Choose low-fat or nonfat milk or yogurt. Yogurt has natural sugar in it, but it can also contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners. Yogurt with artificial sweeteners has fewer calories than yogurt with added sugar.</p><p>MEAT AND FISH</p><p>(2 - 3 servings a day)</p><p>Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.</p><p>FATS, ALCOHOL, AND SWEETS</p><p>In general, you should limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, cheese, bacon, and butter.</p><p>If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar, and to determine a safe amount for you.</p><p>Sweets are high in fat and sugar, so keep portion sizes small. Here are some tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:</p><ul><li>Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.</li><li>Eat sweets that are sugar-free.</li><li>Always ask for the small serving size.</li></ul><p>Learn how to read food labels, and consult them when making food decisions.</p>"

1860,"Type 1 diabetes",4932492,Treatment,"<p>Because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>If you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. Your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. Your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. It may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>As the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. Visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>You are the most important person in managing your diabetes. You should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>How to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>How to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>Diabetes meal planning</li><li>How to give insulin</li><li>How to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>How to adjust insulin and food when you exercise</li><li>How to handle sick days</li><li>Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>INSULIN</p><p>Insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. Everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>Insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. The health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.Sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. Other types of insulin should never be mixed. You may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>Your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. At first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. By age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>People with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>When they exercise</li><li>When they are sick</li><li>When they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>When they are traveling</li></ul><p>   DIET AND EXERCISE</p><p>By testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. This helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>The American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. It can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>Regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. It also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>Talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR</p><p>Checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>To check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. The numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. You and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. You should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. Blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dL are too low and can harm you.</p><p>FOOT CARE</p><p>People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.</p><p>To prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>Stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>Improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>Get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.</li><li>Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.</li><li>Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul><p>PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes.

Reasons why exercise is good for your health:</p><ul><li>Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine</li><li>Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight</li><li>Improves blood flow and blood pressure</li><li>Increases your energy level</li><li>Improves your ability to handle stress</li></ul><p>Talk to your health care provider before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>MEDICATIONS TO TREAT DIABETES</p><p>If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.</p><p>Some of the most common types of medication are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.</p><ul><li>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors </li><li>Biguanides</li><li>DPP IV inhibitors</li><li>Injectable medicines </li><li>Meglitinides </li><li>Sulfonylureas </li><li>Thiazolidinediones </li></ul><p>You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. These conditions are called complications of diabetes.</p><p>FOOT CARE</p><p>People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetesto have foot problems. Diabetes damages thenerves.This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper or infected.</p><p>To prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>Stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>Improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>Get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learnif you have nerve damage.</li><li>Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems. </li><li>Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul>"

1861,"Type 2 Diabetes",4932507,"Possible Complications","<p>After many years, diabetes can lead to serious problems:</p><ul><li>You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind.</li><li>Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.</li><li>Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.</li><li>Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.</li><li>Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.</li><li>High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage.
