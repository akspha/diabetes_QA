CHOSEN ANS:
' gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. most of the time, gestational diabetes goes away after your baby is born. even if your gestational diabetes goes away, you still have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years. your child may also be more likely to become obese and develop type 2 diabetes later in life. making healthy choices helps the whole family and may protect your child from becoming obese or developing diabetes.\n here are steps you should take for yourself and your child if you had gestational diabetes:\n get tested for diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after your baby is born. if your blood glucose is still high, you may have type 2 diabetes. if your blood glucose is normal, you should get tested every 3 years to see if you have developed type 2 diabetes.  \n    be more active and make healthy food choices to get back to a healthy weight.  \n    breastfeed your baby. breastfeeding gives your baby the right balance of nutrients and helps you burn calories.\n     ask your doctor if you should take the diabetes drug metformin to help prevent type 2 diabetes.1'
