CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>gestational diabetes usually starts halfway through the pregnancy. all pregnant women should receive an oral glucose tolerance test between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy to screen for the condition. women who have risk factors for gestational diabetes may have this test earlier in the pregnancy.</p><p>once you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you can see how well you are doing by testing your glucose level at home. the most common way involves pricking your finger and putting a drop of your blood on a machine that will give you a glucose reading.</p>

CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>central diabetes insipidus occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (adh). adh is also called vasopressin. adh is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. it is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. this is a small gland at the base of the brain.</p><p>adh controls the amount of water excreted in urine. without adh, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. the result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. this results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (as much as 4 gallons a day).</p><p>the reduced level of adh may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. this damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation, tumor, or injury to the brain.</p><p>sometimes the cause is unknown. in rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem.</p>

CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ndi) occurs when the kidney tubules do not respond to a chemical in the body called antidiuretic hormone (adh), also called vasopressin. adh normally tells the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated.</p><p>as a result of the defect, the kidneys release an excessive amount of water into the urine, producing a large quantity of very dilute urine. this makes you produce large amounts of urine.</p><p>ndi is rare. congenital diabetes insipidus is present at birth as a result of defect passed down through families that usually affects men. however, women can pass the gene on to their children.</p><p>most commonly, ndi develops because of other reasons. this is called an acquired disorder. factors that can trigger the acquired form of this condition include:</p><ul><li>blockage in the urinary tract</li><li>high calcium levels</li><li>low potassium levels</li><li>use of certain drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin b)</li></ul>

<p>because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>if you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. you should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>how to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>diabetes meal planning</li><li>how to give insulin</li><li>how to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>how to adjust insulin and food when you exercise</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>insulin</p><p>insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.</p><p>foot care</p><p>people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.</p><p>to prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.</li><li>check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.</li><li>make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul><p>preventing complications</p><p>your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. these conditions are called complications of diabetes.</p>

CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. the pancreas is behind the stomach. insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. there, it is stored and later used for energy. </p><p>when you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. this is called insulin resistance. as a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.</p><p>when sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. this is called hyperglycemia.</p><p>type 2 diabetes usually occurs slowly over time. most people with the disease are overweight when they are diagnosed. increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.</p><p>type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. this is more common in the elderly.</p><p>family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. </p>

CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.</p><p>to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested:</p><ul><li>a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul><p>people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either:</p><ul><li>their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>both of the above</li></ul><p>there aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type:</p><ul><li>type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.</li><li>type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul><p>gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.</p><p>diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.</p>

<p>because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>if you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. you should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>how to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>diabetes meal planning</li><li>how to give insulin</li><li>how to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>how to adjust insulin and food when you

enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.</p><p>foot care</p><p>people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if

<p>insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. the pancreas is behind the stomach. insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. there, it is stored and later used for energy. </p><p>when you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. this is called insulin resistance. as a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.</p><p>when sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. this is called hyperglycemia.</p><p>type 2 diabetes usually occurs slowly over time. most people with the disease are overweight when they are diagnosed. increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.</p><p>type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. this is more common in the elderly.</p><p>family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. </p>

<p>because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>if you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. you should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>how to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>diabetes meal planning</li><li>how to give insulin</li><li>how to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>how to adjust insulin and food when you exercise</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>insulin</p><p>insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.</p><p>foot care</p><p>people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.</p><p>to prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.</li><li>check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.</li><li>make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul><p>preventing complications</p><p>your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with

diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>you are the most

in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk

<p>insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.</p><p>to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested:</p><ul><li>a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul><p>people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either:</p><ul><li>their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>both of the above</li></ul><p>there aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type:</p><ul><li>type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.</li><li>type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul><p>gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.</p><p>diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.</p>

CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. the pancreas is behind the stomach. insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. there, it is stored and later used for energy. </p><p>when you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. this is called insulin resistance. as a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.</p><p>when sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. this is called hyperglycemia.</p><p>type 2 diabetes usually occurs slowly over time. most people with the disease are overweight when they are diagnosed. increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.</p><p>type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. this is more common in the elderly.</p><p>family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. </p>

isactivity and nutrition.</p><p>learn these skills</p><p>learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. these skills help prevent healthproblems and the need for medical care. skills include:</p><ul><li>how to test and record your blood glucose</li><li>what to eat and when</li><li>how to take medications, if needed</li><li>how to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them </li></ul><p>it may take several months to learn these skills. keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live with the disease. stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelsyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. this gives you a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>yourhealth care provider or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. your doctor will help you seta target range for your blood sugar numbers. keep these factors in mind:</p><ul><li>most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.</li><li>if your blood sugar level isunder control, you may only need to checkit a few times a week.</li><li>you may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.</li><li>you may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress. </li></ul><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your health care provider. based on your numbers, changes may need to be made to your meals, activity or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. </p><p>diet and weight control</p><p>work closely with your doctor, nurse, and dietitian to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.</p><p>managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. this does not mean that their diabetes is cured. they still have diabetes.</p><p>very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.</p><p>regular physical activity</p><p>regularactivity is important for everyone. it is even more importantwhen you have diabetes. reasons why exercise is good for your health:</p><ul><li>lowers your blood sugar level without medicine</li><li>burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight</li><li>improves blood flow and blood pressure</li><li>increases your energy level</li><li>improves your ability to handle stress</li></ul><p>talk to your health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>medications to treat diabetes</p><p>if diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.</p><p>some of the most common types of medication are listed below. they are taken by mouth or injection.</p><ul><li>alpha-glucosidase inhibitors </li><li>biguanides</li><li>dpp iv inhibitors</li><li>injectable medicines </li><li>meglitinides </li><li>sulfonylureas </li><li>thiazolidinediones </li></ul><p>you may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>preventing complications</p><p>your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. these conditions are called complications of diabetes.</p><p>foot care</p><p>people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetesto have foot problems. diabetes damages thenerves.this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper or infected.</p><p>to prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learnif you have nerve damage.</li><li>check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems. </li><li>make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is

exercise</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>insulin</p><p>insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk toyour health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use adevice called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor or nurse. the numberswill help if you have problems managing your diabetes. you and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. you should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.</p><p>low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. blood sugar levels below 70 mg/dl are too low and can harm you.</p><p>foot care</p><p>people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. diabetes damages the nerves. this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. you may not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.</p><p>diabetes can also damage blood vessels. small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.</p><p>to prevent problems with your feet:</p><ul><li>stop smoking if you smoke.</li><li>improve control of your blood sugar.</li><li>get a foot exam by your health care provider at least twice a year and learn whether you have nerve damage.</li><li>check and care for your feet every day. this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.</li><li>make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. ask your health care provider what is right for you.</li></ul><p>preventing complications</p><p>your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing eye disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that are common in people with diabetes. these conditions are called complications of diabetes.</p>

what is the biggest cause of diabetes
ANS TYPE:
causes 
FOCUS:
 diabetes 
TARGET:
cause 
CHOSEN ANS: 
<p>central diabetes insipidus occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (adh). adh is also called vasopressin. adh is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. it is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. this is a small gland at the base of the brain.</p><p>adh controls the amount of water excreted in urine. without adh, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. the result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. this results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (as much as 4 gallons a day).</p><p>the reduced level of adh may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. this damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation, tumor, or injury to the brain.</p><p>sometimes the cause is unknown. in rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem.</p>

enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or

exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk
