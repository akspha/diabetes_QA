Searching the passaged titled:  Diabetes in Children and Teens
'<p>Until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.</p><p>But now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.</p><p>Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are obese, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active, and do not eat well.  To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children</p><ul><li>Have them maintain a healthy weight</li><li>Be sure they are physically active</li><li>Have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods</li><li>Limit time with the TV, computer, and video</li></ul><p>Children and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be  controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin.</p>'

"<p>because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>if you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, youmay need tohave a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. your health care provider will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. your provider will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. it may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedule.</p><p>as the disease gets more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. visiting your health care provider is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.</p><p>you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. you should know the basic steps to diabetes management:</p><ul><li>how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li><li>how to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li><li>diabetes meal planning</li><li>how to give insulin</li><li>how to check blood glucose and urine ketones</li><li>how to adjust insulin and food when you exercise</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them</li></ul><p>insulin</p><p>insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.</p><p>insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. the health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it.sometypesof insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. other types of insulin should never be mixed. you may need insulin shots from one to four times a day.</p><p>your health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. at first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or other adult. by age 14, most children can give their own injections.</p><p>people with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:</p><ul><li>when they exercise</li><li>when they are sick</li><li>when they will be eating more or less food and calories</li><li>when they are traveling</li></ul><p>   diet and exercise</p><p>by testing their blood sugar level, people with type 1 diabetes learn which foods and activities raise or lower their sugar level most. this helps them adjust their insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or low. </p><p>the american diabetes association and the american dietetic association have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. it can help to talk with a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.</p><p>regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. it also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach a healthy weight.</p><p>talk

'<p>the goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose levels. long-term goals are to prevent problems from diabetes.</p><p>the most important way totreat and managetype 2 diabetes isactivity and nutrition.</p><p>learn these skills</p><p>learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. these skills help prevent healthproblems and the need for medical care. skills include:</p><ul><li>how to test and record your blood glucose</li><li>what to eat and when</li><li>how to take medications, if needed</li><li>how to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar</li><li>how to handle sick days</li><li>where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them </li></ul><p>it may take several months to learn these skills. keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live with the disease. stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.</p><p>managing your blood sugar</p><p>checking your blood sugar levelsyourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.</p><p>to check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. this gives you a tiny drop of blood. you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.</p><p>yourhealth care provider or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. your doctor will help you seta target range for your blood sugar numbers. keep these factors in mind:</p><ul><li>most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.</li><li>if your blood sugar level isunder control, you may only need to checkit a few times a week.</li><li>you may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.</li><li>you may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress. </li></ul><p>keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your health care provider. based on your numbers, changes may need to be made to your meals, activity or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. </p><p>diet and weight control</p><p>work closely with your doctor, nurse, and dietitian to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.</p><p>managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. this does not mean that their diabetes is cured. they still have diabetes.</p><p>very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.</p><p>regular physical activity</p><p>regularactivity is important for everyone. it is even more importantwhen you have diabetes.

blood pressure</li><li>increases your energy level</li><li>improves your ability to handle stress</li></ul><p>talk to your health care provider before starting any exercise program. people with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.</p><p>medications to treat diabetes</p><p>if diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.</p><p>some of the most common types of medication are listed below. they are taken by mouth or injection.</p><ul><li>alpha-glucosidase inhibitors </li><li>biguanides</li><li>dpp iv inhibitors</li><li>injectable medicines </li><li>meglitinides </li><li>sulfonylureas </li><li>thiazolidinediones </li></ul><p>you may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.</p><p>preventing complications</p><p>your
