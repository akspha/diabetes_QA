insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both. to understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. several things happen when food is digested: <ul><li>a sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. glucose is a source of fuel for the body.</li><li>an organ called the pancreas makes insulin. the role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel. </li></ul>people with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar into fat, liver, and muscle cells to be stored for energy. this is because either: <ul><li>their pancreas does not make enough insulin</li><li>their cells do not respond to insulin normally</li><li>both of the above</li></ul>there aretwo major types of diabetes. the causes and risk factors are different for each type: <ul><li>type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. in this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. daily injections of insulin are needed. the exact cause is unknown.</li><li>type 2 diabetes makes up most diabetes cases. it most often occurs in adulthood.but because of high obesity rates, teens and young adults are now being diagnosed with it. many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.</li><li>there are other causes of diabetes, and some patients cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. </li></ul>gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes. diabetes affects more than 20 million americans. over 40 million americans have pre-diabetes (which oftendevelops beforetype 2 diabetes). if your parent, brother or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop diabetes.

CHOSEN ANS: 
type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. it is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults. insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. the pancreas is behind the stomach. insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. there, it is stored and later used for energy. in type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin. without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. the body is unable to use this glucose for energy. this leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. most likely it is an autoimmune disorder.this is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. with type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. type 1 diabetes can be passed down through families.
